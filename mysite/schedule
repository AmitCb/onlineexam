At the first or second week of march In Sha Allah these three features will be completed and then we will show that to you.
Then you will give us a feedback on what to change, delete or add.
Then we will show you an improved system with the rest of the features (Special Exam and payment gateway).
Then you will again give a feedback.
This process will go on until we get it right and you are happy with the system.

In the mean time you should look other sites and get an idea how  your site should look like ie the front end of the site 

Then we will contact with a front end developer.
when the front end developer finishes up  we will integrate that to the main system.
We will show that to you and take feedback from you.
If you dont like then we will contact the front end developer to change or we will change that ourselves
Then again we will show that to you and take feedback. This process will also go on until we get it right.



Then you can hire some one to enter data to the system. You will give them a username and password to the data entry employee. You will be able to give different level of authrization to these employees. 





We need to know how flexiable you are on time ie How soon you want us to finish our job.
In sha Allah by the end of March our job ie back end development will be over then the front end development will begin
But if you want a tight schedule then pls let us know. Then we try our best to finish it up as early as possible with out compromising the feature or the security of the website.
Feel free to call or text me anytime. Your feedback is very very important to us.
